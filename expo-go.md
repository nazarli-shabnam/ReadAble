# Expo Go Quick Start

1. Install Expo Go from App Store
2. Install deps: `corepack yarn install --ignore-engines`
3. Start with tunnel: `corepack yarn start --tunnel`
4. Scan QR code with Expo Go

## Notes

- Camera/OCR: Placeholder only in Expo Go (needs dev build)
- TTS: May be limited on web/Go
- Tunnel slow? Try LAN mode (same Wi‑Fi)
